# Business-Analytics
This project leveraged Python and Web Development tools to develop a business analytics tool.
The project made use of Pandas to read the data and perform the cleaning of the imported data, and Plotly Dash to visualize the data. In addition, the project carried out time series analysis (prediction) using the StatsModel package.

Overall, the project allows users to import their data in a particular format (via the web interface), and in the back-end, performs specific descriptive and predictive analysis on the data.
